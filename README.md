# Moveable-Box-Generator--AngularJS
Task: Moveable box generator-An app to generate new boxes in your app. And move those boxes using your keyboard keys. Expected outcome and steps involved: ● User gets to see a button to add a new box in the window. On clicking the button, a box is created with a unique number ID. Boxes are of fixed width and height. ● Higher id boxes will have a higher z-index. ● Users can add multiple boxes. ● To select a box, click on it. Highlight the selected box. ● Use W-A-S-D or arrow keys on the keyboard to move the selected box. ● Use the ‘delete’ key on the keyboard to remove the selected box. ● A button to toggle keyboard control.(*no listener should be open when this button status is off). ● Avoid using any NPM library to achieve this behaviour. ● Please provide a ReadMe file with your codebase, detailing on how to build and deploy your code in the local browser.
